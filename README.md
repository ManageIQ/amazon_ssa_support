This gem provides support required for running ManageIQ Smart State Analysis (SSA) on Amazon Instances and Images.
There are two use cases in which the gem is used: when running in AWS as an agent, the scanning instance installs the gem to perform SSA on Instances and Images attached to it; on a ManageIQ appliance, the gem is used to issue requests for SSA and handle the responses.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'amazon_ssa_support'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amazon_ssa_support

## Usage

To queue an SSA Extract Request:

    ssaq_args                 = {}
    ssaq_args[:ssa_bucket]    = bucket_name
    ssaq_args[:region]        = region_name
    ssaq_args[:sqs]           = connected_sqs_service
    ssaq_args[:s3]            = connected_s3_service
    ssaq = AmazonSsaSupport::SsaQueue.new(ssaq_args)
    ssaq.send_extract_request(ems_reference, job_id, AmazonSsaSupport::SsaExtractor::CATEGORIES)

To obtain the SSA Extract Response:

    reply = ssaq.reply_loop

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
